This repository provides access to the outcomes of the project ‘Mangrove tree dispersal revealed by genetic, genomic, and oceanographic simulation data: a multi-taxonomic approach in the Western Hemisphere’, such as genetic structure and correlation between dispersal inferred from molecular data and oceanographic simulation.

The data and scripts used will be available here.
